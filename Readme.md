#  QUENCH

Migraine Level: TBD

Quench

Framework: swiftUI
Database: FireBaseFireStore(noSQL)

Overview:

The Quench app is designed to assist users in moderating their intake of some of the most addictive substances. Currently, the app supports Alcohol, Caffeine, and Nicotine. Users can suggest additional substances to be included in future updates, with the most popular suggestions being selected for implementation 

Features:

Item
Users can select between three items and should the percentage reduction gaol.

Map
Based on selected items, the map would show places of high risk to the user

Social:
Users can share badges with friends and check for AA meetings

Body Mass Index:
Using user Weight and height (retrieved from firestore), BMI would be calculated and displayed to each user.

Health
Based on BMI, the userâ€™s category is returned.

Progress
The percentage reduction for items selected will be displayed alongside the number of days without usage.

Rooms for Improvement
Better User Interface.
Current BMI is calculated for ages above 20 years, BMI results for ages below 20 years will be determined by specific age and gender.
Development of the same app using UIkIt.
automatic update of calculated values using onSnapShot() call realtime updates.
full offline support.

Challenges:
Swift UI: The documentation for this framework is relatively sparse because it is still in its early stages of development.
Due to its declarative programming approach, the framework imposes certain restrictions. However, this improves security and reduces breakdown.
Determining ways to reduce the loading time of the app mostly due to improper API networking. 


Known Mistakes Made:
Exposing Google API key. (should know better!)
Improper committing and pushing to GitHub. (I have limited experience using GitHub).
